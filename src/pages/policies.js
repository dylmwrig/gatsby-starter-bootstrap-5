          </p><br/>
          <h4>Statement of Non-Discrimination and Harassment</h4>
          <p>The Filipino American Council of Greater Chicago advocates a positive culture of inclusion and respect for the dignity of each individual. BID opposes all forms of discrimination against and harassment on the basis of an individual’s race, age, religion, creed, color, ancestry, citizenship, national or ethnic origin, language preference, immigration status, disability, medical condition, military or veteran status, social or socioeconomic status or condition, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or any other classification protected by applicable local, state or federal law. This policy applies to visitors and participants to the FACC's Rizal Community Center, FACC volunteers, staff, speakers, program mentors, facilitators, exhibitors, or event venue staff at any FACC event, activity, or meeting.<br/><br/> 
             No person shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity for which they are otherwise eligible. Employees, volunteers, and the families of employees or volunteers can be served in FACC programs as long as they meet eligibility requirements for a program; such individuals shall not receive preference over other individuals eligible for a program nor be discriminated against because of being an FACC employee, volunteer, or family member of an employee or volunteer.
          </p><br/>
          <h4>Harassment-Free FACGC Reporting Process</h4>
          <p>If you have been subjected to or witness to a violation of the FACC's Non-Discrimination and Harassment Policy, the FACC encourages you to report the incident. If you are unsure of how to report, the FACC's executive director can help you get to the right place. If you feel that you or someone else is in immediate danger, please call 911 or contact the FACC executive director.<br/><br/>
            If you are not sure if you want to make a report,  participants and visitors are still entitled to receive confidential and free emotional support with the FACC. Patrons and visitors who wish to report an incident of harassment can contact the FACC executive director.<br/><br/>
          </p>
          <h4>Prohibited Behavior</h4>
          <p>The FACGC prohibits any form of harassment, sexual or in other forms, as set forth in its Non-Discrimination and Harassment Policy (above).<br/>
             Accordingly, some behaviors are specifically prohibited, whether directed at other members, patrons, visitors, attendees, FACC sponsors, funders, staff, volunteers, speakers, facilitators, mentors, exhibitors, or event venue staff.<br/><br/>
             Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees at the event and related event activities. Discussion of opposing or different viewpoints is appropriate but is expected to be conducted in respectful tone and manner that avoids personal attacks. FACC defines harassment to include: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, national origin, gender identity, or disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwelcome following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. In assessing whether following, physical conduct or sexual attention violates this policy, FACC will consider both whether the conduct was subjectively unwelcome to the recipient and whether the alleged violator had a reasonable, objective basis to believe the conduct was invited.<br/><br/>
             Sexual harassment specifically refers to verbal, physical, or visual conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome and offensive to the recipient, such that it impairs the recipient’s ability to fully participate, enjoy, or engage in the FACC event. By way of example, sexual harassment may include such conduct as unwelcome sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; unwelcome verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; an unwelcome display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; and offensive, unwanted physical contact such as patting, pinching, grabbing, groping, or constant brushing against another’s body.<br/><br/>
             Prohibited harassment also includes physical or verbal abuse, intimidation, threats, efforts to annoy others, harassment, stalking, pushing, shoving or use of any physical force whatsoever against any person, which creates a disturbance that is disruptive or dangerous, or creates reasonable apprehension in a person.<br/><br/>
             Members, patrons, attendees or other event participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.<br/><br/>
             As at any event held at the Rizal Community Center, or FACC-sponsored event, the FACC reserves the right to remove any participant whose social attentions become unwelcome to another and who persists in such attentions after their unwelcome nature has been communicated. The FACC also reserves the right to remove or exclude any participant or attendee who appears inebriated or under the influence and who engages in conduct that interferes with the ability of other participants to participate in and enjoy the event.
